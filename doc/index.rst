PyConnect
==================


About
------------------
This is a polymorphic library to connect to Ionicon spectrum data.
It should not matter to the API, whether a spectrum is read from a file or collected just-in-time during a measurement. 
This library provides objects to connect either to a HDF5 file or to a Network Shared Variables (NSV) server and deliver
all the data of interest.
