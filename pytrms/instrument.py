class Instrument:
    '''
    Class for controlling the PTR instrument remotely.

    This class reflects the states of the actual instrument, which can be currently idle
    or running a measurement. An idle instrument can start a measurement. A running
    instrument can be stopped. But trying to start a measurement twice will raise an
    exception (RuntimeError).

    This is a singleton class, i.e. it is only instanciated once per script.
